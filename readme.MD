# Perlin Noise World Class

### A class of several methods to output to the console a terrain generated by Perlin Noise

This class, when downloaded and built, then deployed will put a library into your local repository (Linux: home/.m2/repository).

Can be used to generate 2D terrain according to random values or 2D Perlin noise functions.  Will work on 3D later as needed.

Currently, the plan is to use it to generate 2D levels for a text based RPG (role playing game).

As always, use at your own risk.
